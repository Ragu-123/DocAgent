# DocAgent :Agentic RAG-Powered Multi-Format Document QA

[![Demo on HuggingFace](https://img.shields.io/badge/HuggingFace-Demo-blue)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ragunath-ravi/DocAgent)

---

## 📜 Overview

**DocAgent** is a technically advanced, agent-based document QA system that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and a Model Context Protocol (MCP) to orchestrate autonomous agents that parse, embed, retrieve, and generate answers from multi-format documents including PDF, PPTX, DOCX, CSV, TXT, and Markdown. 

It is implemented with LangChain, HuggingFace, FAISS, Gradio, and Open Source LLMs.

## 🧱 Architecture: Model Context Protocol (MCP) + Agents

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)
MCP is a lightweight, structured message-passing protocol between agents. Each agent receives, processes, and responds using `MCPMessage` over a `MessageBus`.

```python
class MCPMessage:
    sender: str
    receiver: str
    type: str
    trace_id: str
    payload: Dict
```

## 👷 Agents

### 1. IngestionAgent
- Parses files in `.pdf`, `.pptx`, `.docx`, `.csv`, `.txt`, `.md`
- Uses file-type-specific parsing logic: `PyPDF2`, `python-pptx`, `python-docx`, `pandas`, and plain-text readers
- Utilizes `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` for chunking
- Sends chunked LangChain `Document` objects to `RetrievalAgent`

### 2. RetrievalAgent
- Embeds chunked documents using `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- Stores chunks in FAISS vector store
- Handles query requests by returning top-k similar chunks
- Sends `retrieved_context` to `LLMResponseAgent`

### 3. LLMResponseAgent
- Accepts user question and retrieved context
- Constructs system and user messages for a chat-based inference
- Calls HuggingFace's `InferenceClient.chat_completion()` for token streaming
- Streams responses back to `CoordinatorAgent`

### 4. CoordinatorAgent
- Central orchestrator for all user interactions
- Tracks document ingestion status
- Collects streamed LLM responses and sends them to Gradio UI

---

## 🧠 Semantic Search + Vector Store
- All documents are embedded using HuggingFace Sentence Transformers
- FAISS provides fast approximate nearest-neighbor search
- Retrieval is controlled via top-k selection (default: `k=3`)

---

## 🖥️ Gradio Interface

The frontend is powered by a Gradio `Blocks` layout with custom CSS. It features:

- Multi-file uploader with type restrictions
- Upload and processing feedback
- Streaming chatbot interface
- Example prompt suggestions

### Supported File Types
- PDF
- PowerPoint (PPTX)
- Word Documents (DOCX)
- CSV
- TXT
- Markdown

## 🔐 Environment Requirements

```bash
pip install gradio langchain faiss-cpu pandas python-docx python-pptx PyPDF2 huggingface_hub sentence-transformers
```

Add your HuggingFace API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export hf_token=your_hf_token_here
```

---

## 🚀 Run Locally

```bash
python app.py
```

Or launch with Gradio Share:

```python
iface = create_interface()
iface.launch(share=True)
```

---

## 📦 Output
- Responses are streamed token-by-token
- Sources are included inline
- Supports concurrent queries and multiple file types
